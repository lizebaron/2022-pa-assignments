```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Session Aborted
## R encountered a fatal error. The session was terminated.

I received this message on every attempt to run 

```app_data_sample <- read_parquet(paste0(data_path,"app_data_sample.parquet"))

I believe the problems may be due to the age of my computer and I have installed R and R Studio on a different laptop using Linux, but the packages are loading extremely slowly and I'm receiving many error messages doing this as well. Also getting the message that the gender package is not available with R version 3.5.2. I will be getting help with this today and hope to be able to complete the exercise once I can use R successfully on this other laptop.
