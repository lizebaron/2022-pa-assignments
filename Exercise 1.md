##Exercise 1

1. Encouraging employees to contribute $2k or $8k to their retirement

The most likely design of this study is:

R   O1   X1, X3   O2
R   O1   X2, X3   O2
R   O1   X1, X4   O2
R   O1   X2, X4   O2

We know that POPS was studying both the number of 401(k) reminders being sent to employees and the amount Google was asking workers to contribute. We can therefore assume that at least the following treatments were applied:

X1: infrequent reminders
X2: many reminders
X3: $2k ask
X4: $8k ask

Since two different variables were being manipulated, we would need more data to know whether POPS confirmed that many reminders were more effective in getting employees to contribute any amount, rather than only when the ask was $8k. If the results were similar for the $2k ask with both many and infrequent reminders, the reminders may not be having a significant effect. If many reminders were more effective regardless of the amount of the ask, we can accept the conclusion that they appear more effective than infrequent reminders. 

It is also unclear whether POPS was measuring the number of people contributing or only the total amount being contributed. Asking for $2k might make more people contribute, but they may not contribute as much as if they had been asked for $8k. 

2. Since no mention is made of what time frame researchers or the expert are using to evaluate employee performance, it is possible that they are actually making two different but compatible statements about the changes in performance. For example, data may indicate results observed two weeks after each tactic was used. The expert meanwhile may be talking about the results to be expected two months after the tactics are used.

Also, it appears that the two tactics are each being used at different times on the same individuals. If this is the case, it is impossible to say whether any change in performance is due to tactic A or tactic B, since individuals have been exposed to both tactics.
